# OEPL_HA_Automations
OpenEpaperLink Home Assistant Automations for 3.5" e-Ink Displays

Here you'll find a few automations I've created with the help of DeepSeek KI and a lot of trial and error for Home Assistant. 
When you wanna use them you MUST edit the yaml code and insert the ID (not the mac address!) of your e-Ink Display!

The Automations will show:

- Joke of the day
- Quote of the day
Feel free to edit the yaml code and insert some jokes or quotes you like. Or let DeepSeek do this for you! :)

- My local Weatherforecast for the day (you will need to have the pirate weather HACS installed)
- The current temperature of my living room and from the outdoor sensr (you can edit the sensors in the YAML-Code to a sensor in your Home Assistant Configuration)
- My Google Calendar (you must have the google calendar integration installed!)

- The Trash Calendar
(I've used the tutorial video here for installing the needed Sensors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_V1CYLkwwc)

Have fun!
